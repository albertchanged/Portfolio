# [Albert Chang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertchanged)'s Portfolio Website

An elegant, responsive, and user-friendly portfolio website.

It is a culmination of everything I have worked on over my past 4 years of web and front end development!

## Toughest but most fun parts

There were many steps in building this, so I will just discuss the three most difficult ones.

I designed the homepage artwork SVG in Adobe Illustrator. Then I used CSS animations to create the 'CODE' and music notes visuals. I also learned a new way to keep an object in place as it rotates, so once I applied that to the head, I synchronized the head bob with the other animations.

Next, I made CSS hover transitions on the skill boxes follow the direction of their page placement (corner-wise and edge-wise). Try them out when you get to the Skills section!

Lastly, I edited border radii of the objects on the About section, divided the Portfolio section into two rows, and assigned both of them CSS animations. I then utilized jQuery and ES6 JavaScript to watch scroll events, which trigger the animations when the user scrolls the respective objects into view.
